# Research Focus
My work bridges robotics, control systems, and mechanical design, with expertise in:  
🤖 **Bipedal & Legged Robots** (gait optimization, ZMP/MPC control, four-link mechanisms).  
🚀 **3D Hopping Robots** (parallel 3-RSR mechanism, stability enhancement, hardware integration).  
🗺️ **Autonomous Navigation** (SLAM, IMU-camera fusion, path planning for delivery robots).  
🛠️ **Robotic Arms** (6-DOF servo design, Adina structural analysis, industrial applications).
