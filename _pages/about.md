## Research projects {#research-projects}

### Bipedal Robot (2021‚Äì2024)  
- Designed a hybrid-chain biped robot with 12-DOF legs using four-bar linkages to eliminate singularities and enable straight-leg walking.
- Established a simplified dynamic model with the global energy efficiency as the optimization objective, the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method was adopted to optimize the mass distribution and rod length parameters, developed an experimental platform for the hybrid chain bipedal robot based on the optimization results.
