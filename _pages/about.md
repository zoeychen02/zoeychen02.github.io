## Research projects {#research-projects}

### Bipedal Robot (2021‚Äì2024)  
- Designed a hybrid-chain biped robot with 12-DOF legs using four-bar linkages to eliminate singularities and enable straight-leg walking. Developed efficient kinematic solutions via vector coordinate methods, validated in MATLAB.
- Established a simplified dynamic model with the global energy efficiency as the optimization objective, the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method was adopted to optimize the mass distribution and rod length parameters.
- Developed an experimental platform for the hybrid chain bipedal robot based on the optimization results. The key components were optimized through static analysis, a hierarchical control system was designed, and the feasibility of the kinematic trajectory was verified through ROS+RVIZ simulation.

### Autonomous mobile robot (2022‚Äì2024)
Design a lightweight mobile robot structure and add an anti-collision chassis design to reduce wear.
Developed multi-sensor navigation system (LiDAR+IMU+RGB-D) with adaptive fusion algorithm.

### 6-DOF Robotic Arm (2022‚Äì2024)
-Completed mechanical design and FEA analysis (Adina) for educational robotic arm. -Developed object recognition and grasping using OpenCV.

### 3D Hopping Robot with 3-RSR Mechanism (2024‚Äì2025)
Optimize 3-RSR parallel mechanism for stable 3D hopping.
Implemented PID-based altitude control with propeller assistance.(2D&3D)
