### Bipedal Robot (2021–2024)  
- Designed a hybrid-chain biped robot with 12-DOF legs using four-bar linkages to eliminate singularities and enable straight-leg walking.
- Established a simplified dynamic model with the global energy efficiency as the optimization objective, the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method was adopted to optimize the mass distribution and rod length parameters, developed an experimental platform for the hybrid chain bipedal robot based on the optimization results.

### 3D Hopping Robot with 3-RSR Mechanism (2024–2025)
- Developed a propeller-enhanced hopping robot with optimized 3-RSR parallel leg mechanism, achieving stable locomotion through strategic thruster placement and dynamic torque balancing.
- Created a hybrid control system integrating leg dynamics and propeller thrust allocation, implementing real-time QP-based optimization for disturbance rejection (20° recovery capability).
